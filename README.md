👋 Hi, I'm Rudy

I'm an experienced Infrastructure Engineer with a strong background in systems administration, IaC, automation, and cloud engineering.

When I am not working on a project at work or in my home lab, I enjoy spending time with my fiance, mountain biking, hiking, playing (or watching) basketball, video games, and finding new places to eat.
