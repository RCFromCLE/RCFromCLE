- Python
- Terraform Cloud
- Azure Landing Zones
- Microsoft 365 - (Exchange and ADDS)
- Active Directory
- Azure
- Azure Dev Ops
- PowerShell
- CMD

When I am not working on a project at work or in my home lab, I enjoy spending time with my family, mountain biking, hiking, playing (or watching) basketball, video games, and finding new places to eat.
